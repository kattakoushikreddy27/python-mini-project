to achieve your goal of identifying the user's input, determining the task, and suggesting the best AI or website for that task, you can use a combination of natural language processing and pre-defined task-tool mappings. Here's a more detailed approach:

Input Processing:
Use a natural language processing (NLP) library to process the user's input and extract the keywords or phrases that indicate the type of task they need to complete. For example, you can use spaCy or NLTK for this purpose.

Task Identification:
Compare the extracted keywords or phrases with a list of pre-defined tasks. If a match is found, you can proceed to suggest a tool for that task. You might need to use techniques like fuzzy matching or string similarity to handle variations in input.

Tool Recommendation:
Based on the identified task, provide a recommendation for the best AI or website that can help the user complete that task. This recommendation can be stored in a dictionary or database.


outcome should be 
user : irregular sentence to ask which website or ai can do this work

answer: use this website for answer
